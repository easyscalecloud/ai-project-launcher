AI Project Launcher is a productivity tool for power users who manage numerous Claude and ChatGPT projects. It extracts project metadata from HTML and integrates with Alfred's workflow capabilities to provide lightning-fast, keyboard-driven access to all your AI assistants. With just a few keystrokes, instantly search across hundreds of projects using powerful full-text searchâ€”bypassing the slow, imprecise browser-based navigation.

The implementation requires minimal setup: extract HTML from your project pages, run the Python script to build the search index, and configure the Alfred workflow. Maintenance is straightforward, requiring just a minute to refresh your project catalog whenever you create new AI assistants. The codebase is clean, well-documented, and handles both Claude and ChatGPT projects.
